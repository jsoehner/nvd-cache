## 1. Context and Problem Statement

The `nvd-cache` repository automates the synchronization, compression, and distribution of the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) H2 cache database used by OWASP Dependency-Check in continuous integration (CI) workflows. Because this repository serves as a foundational upstream security caching component for enterprise CI vulnerability scanners, establishing verifiable software and cryptographic provenance is critical.

With the enforcement of Executive Order 14028, NIST SP 800-218 (Secure Software Development Framework), NIST SP 800-161 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management), and impending Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) federal transitions (NIST FIPS 203/204/205, CNSA 2.0), software artifacts and release pipelines must provide transparent, machine-readable manifests of their dependencies and cryptographic capabilities.

Prior to this decision, `nvd-cache` maintained automated database updates and basic CI security checks, but lacked:
1. Standardized dual-format Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation compliant with NTIA minimum elements.
2. Automated Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM) generation tracking cryptographic algorithms, key lengths, and protocols.
3. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness evaluation to discover quantum-vulnerable algorithms versus quantum-resistant primitives.
4. Semantic Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) scanning to correlate code call sites with inventory manifests.
5. In-pipeline verification harnesses ensuring corrupt or empty BOM artifacts fail CI prior to artifact distribution.

### 1.1 Business & Compliance Drivers
- **Regulatory / Compliance**: Executive Order 14028, NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF), NIST SP 800-161 (C-SCRM), NTIA Minimum Elements for SBOMs, CNSA 2.0 PQC migration milestones.
- **Enterprise Integrity**: Ensure that the NVD database caching pipeline itself maintains verifiable software provenance and cryptographic security standards.

### 1.2 Threat & Vulnerability Context
- **Threat Vector (STRIDE)**: Tampering (upstream package corruption or workflow injection), Information Disclosure, Repudiation.
- **Vulnerabilities Mitigated**: CWE-1395 (Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party Component), CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), CWE-1104 (Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components).
- **CVSS / Risk Rating**: Medium (6.5)
- **Scope**: Repository dependencies, workflow actions, build scripts, and distributed caching artifacts.

## 2. Decision Drivers & Constraints

- Automatically generate dual-standard SBOMs: CycloneDX 1.5/1.6 JSON and SPDX 2.3 JSON using Anchore/Syft.
- Generate CycloneDX 1.6 Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM) via `cbomkit-action` with fallback offline catalog reconciliation.
- Deploy dual-engine cryptographic discovery using semantic AST scanning (`scan_crypto_ast.py`) across source files.
- Provide automated CI test verification (`test_boms.sh`) verifying JSON validity, schema compliance, and asset presence.
- Evaluate Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness and publish automated GitHub Actions Step Summaries and documentation (`analyze_cbom.py`).
- Maintain local CLI parity so developers can generate and verify BOMs offline without requiring cloud CI.
- Adhere to GitHub Actions hardening standards: Node 24 runtime, immutable commit SHA pinning, and least-privilege permissions.

## 3. Considered Options

| Option | Approach Summary | Security Benefits | Trade-offs & Costs | Residual Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Option A (Chosen)** | Automated dual-engine SBOM (CycloneDX + SPDX via Syft) and CBOM (cbomkit + semantic AST scanning) pipeline with PQC assessment and verification test harness. | Full NTIA compliance, cryptographic asset transparency, automated PQC readiness grading, zero vendor lock-in, local CLI parity. | Requires initial tooling setup (Syft, cbomkit, Python AST analyzer) and artifact storage in CI. | Low |
| **Option B** | Single SPDX-only SBOM generated at release time without CBOM or AST crypto scanning. | Minimal CI overhead and simple single-file generation. | Leaves zero visibility into cryptographic primitives or quantum vulnerability; lacks CycloneDX CBOM interoperability. | High |
| **Option C** | Proprietary commercial SaaS platform for supply chain governance. | Centralized enterprise dashboards managed externally. | High licensing cost, vendor lock-in, lack of offline execution for local pre-commit checks or air-gapped environments. | Medium |

## 4. Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Option A** — Deploy automated dual-format SBOM & CBOM generation, AST cryptographic scanning, verification testing, and PQC migration analysis.

### 4.1 Rationale
Adopting Anchore/Syft provides industry-standard dual-format SBOM generation covering CycloneDX and SPDX. Integrating `cbomkit` alongside semantic AST scanning provides an automated cryptographic inventory capable of tracking quantum-safe readiness (e.g., ML-KEM, ML-DSA) versus classical algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECC). Incorporating a deterministic verification harness (`test_boms.sh`) directly into the CI pipeline guarantees that any corrupt or missing BOM artifact breaks the build, preventing unverified releases.

## 5. Security, Risk & Compliance Impact

### 5.1 CIA Triad Evaluation
- **Confidentiality**: BOM files document public package metadata and cryptographic algorithms; secrets, credentials, and API keys are strictly excluded and governed by Gitleaks.
- **Integrity**: Standardized JSON artifacts provide verifiable cryptographic digests (SHA-256) of every dependency and tool, preventing unauthorized tampering.
- **Availability**: BOM generation is automated in CI and runs in under two minutes, with local tooling providing offline execution without external SaaS dependency.

### 5.2 Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Transition
The CBOM analyzer flags classical asymmetric cryptography (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, DH, ECDH) as quantum-vulnerable, providing continuous visibility as upstream dependencies and tooling transition to post-quantum algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA).

## 6. Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Audit Readiness**: Immediate compliance with Executive Order 14028, NIST SSDF, and federal SBOM requirements.
- **Dual Format Interoperability**: Support for both CycloneDX and SPDX ensures broad compatibility across scanning tools and enterprise consumers.
- **Cryptographic Transparency**: Continuous inventory of cryptographic algorithms and post-quantum migration tracking.
- **Automated Quality Gate**: The verification test harness prevents defective or empty BOMs from passing CI.
- **Local Developer Parity**: Developers can run BOM generation and verification locally using identical scripts.

### Negative Consequences & Trade-offs
- **CI Build Duration**: Adds approximately 1–2 minutes to pipeline runs.
- **Storage Overhead**: Generates artifact files in the `oss/` directory during workflow runs (managed via 90-day retention and gitignored locally).

### New Constraints
- The `oss/` directory must remain ignored in version control (`.gitignore`) to avoid committing ephemeral scan outputs.
- Future dependency additions or cryptographic updates must pass `scripts/test_boms.sh` in pull requests.

### Follow-on Activities
- Maintain automated GitHub Releases bundling verified SBOMs alongside NVD database cache archives.
- Periodically update Syft and cbomkit action versions pinned to immutable commit hashes.
